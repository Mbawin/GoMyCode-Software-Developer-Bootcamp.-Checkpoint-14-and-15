write an algorithm that read a sentence, which ends with a point, character by character,
and to determine The length of the sentence (the number of characters):

algorithm
1. Initialize a counter variable to store the length of the sentence. Set it to 0.
2. Read the first character of the sentence.
3. Repeat the following steps until the current character is a period:
   -Increment the counter by 1.
   -Read the next character.
4. The value of the counter now represents the length of the sentence.


write an algorithm that read a sentence, which ends with a point, character by character,and to
determine The number of words in the sentence (assuming that the words are separated by a single space).

1. Initialize a counter variable to store the number of words. Set it to 0.
2. Read the first character of the sentence.
3. Repeat the following steps until the current character is a period:
  -If the current character is a space and the previous character was not a space, 
   increment the word counter.
  -Read the next character.
4. If the last character before the period is not a space, increment the word counter.
5. The value of the counter now represents the number of words in the sentence.


write an algorithm that read a sentence, which ends with a point, character by character, and to
determine The number of vowels in the sentence.

1. Initialize a counter variable to store the number of vowels. Set it to 0.
2. Read the first character of the sentence.
3. Repeat the following steps until the current character is a period:
   -Check if the current character is a vowel (a, e, i, o, u, or their uppercase counterparts).
   -If it is a vowel, increment the vowel counter.
   -Read the next character.
4. The value of the counter now represents the number of vowels in the sentence.
